			<p class="bodyText">Cannabis Education begins with acknowledging that cannabis itself is far more than just a "drug" — it's a complex plant with a <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.3389%2Ffphar.2017.00108">long history of medicinal use</a> that dates back to ancient eastern medical practices. The idea of cannabis as an illicit substance (or as some would call it, "the devil's lettuce") is relatively new, dating back to back to the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/dope/etc/cron.html">"reefer madness" era</a> of the 1930s. Furthermore, the ideas of the reefer madness era weren't based in anything factual, let alone scientific — <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/07/14/201981025/the-mysterious-history-of-marijuana">the ideas</a> were spouted to promote a harmful, disturbing, and destructive anti-immigrant sentiment toward Mexican individuals who had migrated to the United States.</p>
			<p class="bodyText">Without getting too into the weeds about the roots of the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/17/the-us-has-spent-over-a-trillion-dollars-fighting-war-on-drugs.html">War on Drugs</a> and the devastating impact it still has on countless Americans today, the only way to pursue real change begins with educating others on what we <i>actually</i> have observed in studies on the physiological effects of cannabis. You can learn more about cannabis through websites like <a href="https://www.leafly.com/">Leafly</a> and <a href="https://weedmaps.com/">WeedMaps</a>, or through the <strong>free</strong> studies published on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubMed</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/">ScienceDirect</a>.</p>
